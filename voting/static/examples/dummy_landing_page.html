  	<h1>This is a Dummy Landing Page</h1>
  	<p>
  		This dummy page has to be replaced in the future with a better landing page. However, the main objective of this page is to provide a gateway to the <strong>different</strong> views of each stakeholder involved in <strong>HackPortal</strong>. 
  		<ul>
  			<li>An Attendee Team(There can be <strong>n</strong> teams...so there should be <strong>n</strong> passwords)</li>
  			<li>A judge(There can be <strong>m</strong> judges..so there should be <strong>m</strong> passwords)</li>
  			<li>SLAC Cafeteria(Single login)</li>
  			<li>SLAC Organizers(They don't get a login; coz they have the DB itself)</li>
  		</ul>
  		<strong>Here, we shall put 4 direct links for now.</strong>
  		<br>
  		<strong>But, strong validation needs to be implemented!</strong>
