The adoption of blockchains worldwide involves a wide range of goods and services such as, property rights, 
healthcare and humanitarian aid. However, what needs special attention is their huge impact on the reversal of the way elections are held. 
Proper implementation will help mobilize new constituencies, strengthen voter turnout, 
reduce violence and hold elections in safer and more credible conditions. <br><br>

In the event of elections, certified voters will be able to vote electronically using blockchains, 
where their votes will be secure and transparent, while protecting the citizen personal data. 
In addition, the security measures included, are promising for the wider dissemination and assurance of electronic voting. 
Much of this success is based on the strong security of blockchains and adherence to their rules. <br><br>

In this video we present BlockVote, an election system that operates using blockchain technology. <br><br>


Let's start with a brief tour of the user interface by looking at its features. <br><br>

This page is the home page that the user will see when they visit the application for the first time. 
From here the user has the option to start the voting process or to check his vote in case he has already voted. <br><br>

This system divides users into two different categories. The simple users and the administrators.<br><br>

A simple user has the right to take part in the voting and to check his own vote. On the other hand, 
an administrator can also take part in the voting, but at the same time he has some additional rights. 
At any time, an administrator can retrieve information about all the data that is stored so far in the 
blockchain as well as count the votes in order to find the winner. These functions will be presented in detail later in this video. <br><br>

We will start by assuming that the user is using the application for the first time and therefore wants  
to start the voting process. <br><br>

This is the page where users can vote. Initially a table presents the details of the candidates
 so that the user can make his choice. In order to conduct the voting, the user must provide their 
 personal id, and the id of the candidate who wants to vote. If all the information, he has provided 
 is correct then the voting process is completed successfully, and his vote is stored in the blockchain as we will see soon. <br><br>

The system is designed in such a way that all users can vote only once. So, if a user tries to
 vote again with the same id the system will refuse his vote.  <br><br>

Once the user has completed the voting process successfully and their vote has been included in 
the blockchain, it is now able to check their vote. All he needs to do is provide the personal id he used during the voting process. <br><br>

The system is also capable of detecting errors such as submitting incorrect information and not 
being able to find candidates or voters in the blockchain. <br><br>
